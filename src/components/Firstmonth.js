                i panicked a lot and i was afraid because you scare me
                a lot but trust me my feelings for you were stronger 
                than anything else in this world.<br/> 
                once i told you that i have a special picture that im keeping
                to myself in my phone so here it is ↞↞ <br/>
                ↝ a confess : Actually this picture is so special to me when we were apart i keep looking at it
                all the night to fall asleep ❃❃
