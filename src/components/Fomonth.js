                <p className="me">I listen to your eyes because they speak so much truth. <br></br>
                From those eyes came a sense of feeling home. And it happens to be you <br></br>
                They say the eyes are windows, the thing is, my love, I can see through them. <br></br> 
                I can see your pain and your gentleness just the same. I see how every emotion comes together to form the art of your soul. <br></br> 
                It forms a picture I see in an instant and comprehend with full depth. So, I see you, I do. <br></br>
                 When I say that your eyes are beautiful, its the truth, for it's not about colours or shape, it's about the loving sweet essence that is so clearly there.<br></br>
