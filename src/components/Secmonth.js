            You’re always on my mind You’re all I want, all I need.<br/>
                 You’re my whole entire world. Babe, you know I love you and I tell you everyday to remind you, but you’ll never know how much I love you because my love for you can’t be expressed in words. <br/>
                I know I’m not the best, but I’ll always be here for you if you let me. <br></br> How I wish that I could spend my whole life under the skies watching the stars with you? You’re the first and last person I want in my life.<br/>
                 No amount of distance, pain, fights or differences in opinion can break our bond. We’re like the best of friends and the deepest of lovers.<br></br> You are on my mind every second, every minute, every hour, every day and every single time I blink. 
                 You fill all the space in my mind and heart. I love you baby. When I am with you, it feels like a dream come true.<br></br>
                 ❣❣ You are my angel from heaven. I love you.❣❣</p>
