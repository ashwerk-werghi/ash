                <div>   
                <h2 className="sto"> ↬ the first time i told you about the "S" story :</h2>
                <p className="stor"> when i was on my way home i was thinking a lot like 
                    how i dare to share this kind of story not because
                    i don't trust you but because i felt like im giving such 
                    a bad impact on the person that im talking to <br></br>
                    it made feel terrible for a moment i thought that im going 
                    to lose you ... i don't why but i was afraid <br></br>
                    at that moment also i felt something else : that i've found
                    the one ... <br></br>
                    the one that i can talk to without borders
                    the one that i can share with my fears my flaws my downs <br></br>
                    simply i felt that i've found the one that i can be ME with <br></br>
                    ♡ I JUST FOUND YOU DARLING.♡

                    <h4 className="sto"> ↬ our first kiss :</h4>
                    <p className="stor">maybe you think im silly, but these things matter to me <br></br>
                     Actually, i thought it's a lie when they say a kiss can make you fall
                     in love over again with someone <br></br>
                     however when we kissed it was different in a good way <br></br>
                     it was a break from the world , a trip to a different universe i can't describe the intense of that feeling <br></br>
                     have i ever felt before ... BIG NOOO <br></br>
                     it's true that i say sometimes that im heartless and i don't have feelings BUT ...
                     i think you got what i wanted to say <br></br>
                     thank you BAE for being such a fundamental part in my life <br></br>
